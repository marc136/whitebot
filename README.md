# whitebot

This repository and its [documentation web site](http://marc136.github.io/whitebot/) were created for a students' project at Stuttgart Media Univerisity (Hochschule der Medien Stuttgart) in the winter term 2014-15.
_**Documentation was written in German**_

Aim of this project was to enhance an existing project that allowed a small robot to move arbitrarily on a magnetic white board.  
The robot may also draw on the board with a pen, that way it is possible to create Graphs or Images.  
The controller that was implemented in this project is based on a generation-based machine learning approach and enables to compensate for errors in precision due to gravitation, measuring inaccuracy of the sensors and nature of the surfacee.  

##Documentation
The documentation is located in the _gh-pages_ branch and uses the static page generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) and the [github pages gem for Ruby](https://github.com/github/pages-gem).
